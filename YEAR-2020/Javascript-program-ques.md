119. what ? means
116. if we pass object as refernce in a function object value chnages otherwise not .
112. what is next in generator functions
111. Throws reference error if it tries to access varible before declaraing it
106. two ways of accessing a object. if u have object key in a variable then a[b] else a.b
105. Object comparision takes place by refernce means whether they are refernecing same object.
