Html and Css

Tags: header,footer,select(option),forms(checkbox),span,nav,ol,li,labels
 In a process of creating a webGallery..
 Why we add min.js or css file- bec it’s a minified version for faster loading.
 Minified version is created after making variables name replaced by some character like that.
 Minified version can be created using grunt.
 There are two bootstrap one is angular ui and other the basic one. Basic one has css which   supports in angularjs but js file doesn’t have support so, a abstract layer is created which is angular ui which support this.
Sequence of importing js file matters.
We have to use ejs template.
Single page application means server will give response to index.ejs and from their html pages are rendered
Note:
global default font-size is 14px, with a line-height of 1.428

<!DOCTYPE html> - This line informs browser which version of html being used

         <link>
        <embed>
       <source>
      <meta>
      <wbr>
     <param>

Common html terms
elements, tags and attributes
Common css terms
	Selectors, properties, values

Type selector
Class selector
Id selector

Why do css reset? - To support cross browser compatibility
Eg : Eric Meyer’s reset

<p> hold semantic value while <div> doesn’t hold semantic value.
Semantic value means it has some meaning
HTMl5 got some structured value elements
<header> <section> <article> <aside> <footer>
Difference - <header> vs. <head> vs. <h1> through <h6> Elements
All styles will cascade from the top of our style sheet to the bottom of our style sheet. = Cascade properties(override by next style)
Specificity - Id selector has highest and type selector has lowest
1-0-0 : id : class : type
0 - 0 -1  : first means high selector preference 2nd means medium preferences 3rd means low prefernces
No matter where all id selector has been used. It will take override type selector. In that order doesn’t matter. Top css will remain same
My q : Where  to use type selector then?

Combining selectors
.hotdog .musturd -  will be applied to any element with the class value hotdog and musturd
.hotdog p.musturd - will be read from right to left, will select p under hotdog class

Higher the specificty weight more chances of cascade break
pixels, percentages, and em units are mostly used relative fonts

Block level - takes whole width regardless of content
Inline-level - takes space as required by content

Display property can be changed by just setting 
P : {
Display : block
}

P: {
Display : inline
}
P : {
Display : inline-block //will display inline with other elements won’t start with the new line
}
Silghtly small difference exists between two inline block
Inline-level elements cannot have a fixed size
Width and height are only relevant to non inline element
 Margins only work horizontally—left and right—on inline-level elements. Padding works on all four sides of inline-level elements
Margin : have to put all sides
Margin-top ; have to put only one side
For margins we see color of parent element
For padding we see color of element to which padding is applied
border-bottom-width: 12px;
 border-radius property identifies by which value corner of box will be rounded
border-top-right-radius: 5px;
Css3 introduced box sizing property  with values content-box, padding-box, and border-box
For vendor specific we can write like 
-webkit-box-sizing: content-box;
     -moz-box-sizing: content-box;
          box-sizing: content-box;
