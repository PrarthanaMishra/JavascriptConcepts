use db - // It will create data even it doesn't exist

show dbs is not showing all the databases
Reason for that -
    if user doesn't create any collection or add user to newly created database, mongodb doesn't show newly created database when "show dbs" command is issued.

Why collection was not showing up even after creating them by code
  Ans : It's because in config.js file, model was not pointing to the correct DB
